# [Project 1](https://github.com/MacOwusu/MacOwusu.github.io/blob/main/FinalProjectRMD.pdf)
The link above includes a project in which a classmate and I used RStudio to import two datasets that included life expectancy in the United States as well as life expectancy in the world to create multiple visuals and perform statistical analysis such as k-means clustering, and residual plots that helped us draw inferences on life expectancy in the US vs the world considered factors such as country status, sex, race, and diseases. 


# [Project 2](https://github.com/MacOwusu/MacOwusu.github.io/blob/main/Final%20Project%20397a.ipynb)
Performed statistical analysis such as Clustering and Classification using python on Visual Studio Code on a database with a dataset of a financial well-being survey. SQL was also used to retrieve and manipulate the database to show the numbers and ranges used.
