# [Predicting the Scope of Life Expectancy in the World](https://github.com/MacOwusu/MacOwusu.github.io/blob/main/FinalProjectRMD.pdf), Spring 2022
The link above includes a project in which a classmate and I used RStudio to import two datasets that included life expectancy in the United States as well as life expectancy in the world to create multiple visuals and perform statistical analysis such as k-means clustering, and residual plots that helped us draw inferences on life expectancy in the US vs the world considered factors such as country status, sex, race, and diseases. 


# [Financial Well-Being and Education](https://github.com/MacOwusu/MacOwusu.github.io/blob/main/Final%20Project%20397a.ipynb), Winter 2022
In this link above there were statistical analysis performed such as Clustering and Classification using python on Visual Studio Code using a dataset of a financial well-being survey. The main goal of this project was to see how poverty status and education were related to ones well-being. SQL was also used to retrieve and manipulate the database to show the numbers and ranges used, and several visualizations were made to compare different factors.

# [Clustering]
This is a project where I practiced clustering by taking a dataset with various data of Massachusetts and isolating the specific information I wanted. My goal was to find the correlation between a town's violent crimes per 1,000 residents based on the the number of gun license holders per 1,000 residents. Using pandas and sklearn I was able to select 3 columns as variables and separate them into 5 clusters and draw conclusions from the data.
