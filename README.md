# [Predicting the Scope of Life Expectancy in the World](https://github.com/MacOwusu/MacOwusu.github.io/blob/main/FinalProjectRMD.pdf), Spring 2022
The link above includes a project in which a classmate and I used RStudio to import two datasets that included life expectancy in the United States as well as life expectancy in the world to create multiple visuals and residual plots that helped us draw inferences on life expectancy in the US vs the world considering factors such as country status, sex, race, and diseases. An example of one of the visuals created lies below:

# [Financial Well-Being and Education](https://github.com/MacOwusu/MacOwusu.github.io/blob/main/Final%20Project%20397a.ipynb), [SQL Portion](https://github.com/MacOwusu/MacOwusu.github.io/blob/main/--%20SQLite.sql) Winter 2022
In this link above there were statistical analysis performed such as Clustering and Classification using python on Visual Studio Code using a dataset of a financial well-being survey. The main goal of this project was to see how poverty status and education were related to ones well-being. Using packages such as pandas, geopy, plotly, sklearn, seaborn, matplotlib, and numpy the dataset was imported and made into visuals. Then the data was clustered into 3 clusters using the "average" linkage method. Then the poverty rate was classified on a 80% and 20% testing and training split and finally tested for accuracy and fit onto a model. SQL was also used to retrieve and manipulate the database to show the numbers and ranges used, and several visualizations were made to compare different factors. 

# [Keyboard Master](https://kbmstr.com/), [Writeup](https://github.com/MacOwusu/MacOwusu.github.io/blob/main/ACM_Conference_Proceedings_Primary_Article_Template__4_.pdf), Fall 2022
In this group project 3 classmates and myself worked to create a webapp that has three features that help users improve their efficiency when typing. Users are able to configure, generate, and practice a keyboard layout personalized specifically to them. Our goal was to make typing easier and more efficient, as well as move the world away from the unquestioned norm of QWERTY keyboards. This project consisted of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.

# [Clustering](https://github.com/MacOwusu/MacOwusu.github.io/blob/main/mass_cluster.ipynb) Fall 2022
This is a project where I took dataset with various data of Massachusetts and isolated the specific information I wanted. My goal was to find the correlation between a town's violent crimes per 1,000 residents based on the the number of gun license holders and police spending per 1,000 residents. Using pandas and sklearn I was able to perform hierarchical clustering on this dataset with five clusters using the "average" linkage method. I selected those 3 columns and separated them into 5 clusters and drew conclusions from the results that can be found on the bottom of the code. 

# [Data Cleaning](https://github.com/MacOwusu/MacOwusu.github.io/blob/main/hospital_map.ipynb) Fall 2022
In this project I imported the libraries pandas, geopy, and plotly.express, and read in two data files, "hospital_locs.tsv" and "hospital_sizes.tsv". I then performed some data cleaning by removing commas and converting string values to integer values in the columns. I then concatenated the two data sets based on their index and assigned the results to the variable "hosp_df". Once that was finished I then performed more data cleaning on the "hosp_df" dataset and then plotted it to an interactive scatter plot on a map that I created as well using plotly and mapbox, a screenshot of the plot is shown below.
